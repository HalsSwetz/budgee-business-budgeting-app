***BudgEase*** is a tool designed to help businesses track their finances, manage monthly expenses, and achieve financial goals. ***BudgEase*** is a simple, intuitive platform that allows the user to clearly view their target budget goals, their actual recorded budget, and then see the variance between the two.  ***BudgEase*** even has a data visualization feature to show the user a clear visual of their monthly variance in budget.

BudgEase was inspired by the real-life need for entrepreneurs and business ownersâ€”especially those running smaller or growing companiesâ€”to easily and clearly monitor their spending vs. budget goals.  

BudgEase gives you insight into your business's financial health in real time.
